   <p>
       A croissant [UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/, US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)] is a buttery, flaky, 
       French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened 
       laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, 
       rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
       The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using 
brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. 
The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
 with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.

  Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
